    "• /spurge - silent purge, it's same as /purge but won't send the \"Purge Completed\" message.\n\n"
    "• /del - this will delete the replied message.\n\n"
    "• /purgefrom and /purgeto: reply to a message with /purgefrom (it will be marked) and then follow it with a /purgeto. Doing so will delete all the messages between the marked /purgefrom message and /purgeto.\n"
